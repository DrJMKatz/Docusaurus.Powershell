Docusaurus.Powershell generates fully functioning
[Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) documentation websites using
the Comment-Based Help found in Powershell Module source files.

Best of both worlds:

- document Powershell using the familiar Get-Help syntax
- leave website development to the front-end community

## Early Bird

Just like Docusaurus v2, this module is still in it's early stages.
Features are deliberately kept to a minimum so we can make
things work first, then make it better.

Suggestions, fixes and bug reports welcome at our
[Github repository](https://github.com/alt3/Docusaurus.Powershell).
