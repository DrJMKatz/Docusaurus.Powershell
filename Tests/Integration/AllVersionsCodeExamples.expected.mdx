## SYNOPSIS
Dummy module to ensure all supported Get-Help example variations render identically on all Powershell versions.

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Test-AllVersionsCodeExamples
```

## DESCRIPTION
{{ Fill in the Description }}

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
$description = 'Native single-line example without description'
```

### EXAMPLE 2
```powershell
$description = 'Native single-line example with single-line description'
```

This is description line 1

### EXAMPLE 3
```powershell
$description = 'Native single-line example with non-adjacent multi-line description'
```

This is description line 1

This is description line 2

### EXAMPLE 4
```powershell
$description = 'Native single-line example with adjacent multi-line description'
```

This is description line 1
This is description line 2

### EXAMPLE 5
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single-line example without description'
```

### EXAMPLE 6
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single-line example with single-line description'
```

This is description line 1

### EXAMPLE 7
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single-line example with non-adjacent multi-line description'
```

This is description line 1

This is description line 2

### EXAMPLE 8
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single-line example with adjacent multi-line description'
```

This is description line 1
This is description line 2

### EXAMPLE 9
```powershell
$description = 'Complex code-fenced example without description'
$names | Foreach-Object {} {
    write-host 'indentation is respected'
    Write-Host 'enormously long lines will not get cut off by our PlatyPS friends, ftw'
}

$multipleNewlinesInCode = $True
```

### EXAMPLE 10
```powershell
$description = 'Complex code-fenced example with a complex markdown description'
$names | Foreach-Object {} {
    write-host 'indentation is respected'
    Write-Host 'enormously long lines should not get cut off by our PlatyPS friends, ftw'
}

$multipleNewlinesInCode = $True
```

The description would continue after first closing code fence.

This solution:

- respects indentation
- will treat description as markdown
- seems close to what comes natural

With this solution, the description itself could even contain code blocks:

```js
$var = docusaurus.New($config);
```

Pretty cool and one could argue that the console becomes more readable too
as you can now at least see where the code ends and the explanation begins

```
$unMonicked = "this code block should stay unmonicked, in other words powershell should not be added"
    $indentationRespected = $True
$theBadNews - "that PlatyPS seems to cut off this line if a .
is detected, wtf"
```

### EXAMPLE 11
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single line example using POWERSHELL MONIKER without description'
```

### EXAMPLE 12
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single line example using POWERSHELL MONIKER with single-line description'
```

This is description line 1

### EXAMPLE 13
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single line example using POSH MONIKER without description'
```

### EXAMPLE 14
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single line example using POSH MONIKER with single-line description'
```

This is description line 1

### EXAMPLE 15
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single line example using PS MONIKER without description'
```

### EXAMPLE 16
```powershell
$description = 'Code-fenced single line example using PS MONIKER with single-line description'
```

This is description line 1
